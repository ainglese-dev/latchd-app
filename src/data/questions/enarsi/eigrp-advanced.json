    "question": "By default, which two metrics does EIGRP use to calculate its composite metric?",
    "options": ["Bandwidth and Delay", "Bandwidth and Reliability", "Delay and Load", "Hop count and MTU"],
    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "EIGRP by default uses only bandwidth and delay in its composite metric calculation. Although reliability, load, and MTU are included in the metric formula, their K-values (K2, K3, K4, K5) are set to 0 by default, making them inactive. Only K1 (bandwidth) and K3 (delay) are enabled."

    "question": "What is a Feasible Successor in EIGRP?",
    "options": ["The best route to a destination", "A backup route that meets the feasibility condition", "Any route advertised by a neighbor", "The route with the lowest hop count"],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "A Feasible Successor is a backup route to a destination that satisfies the feasibility condition: its Advertised Distance (AD) must be less than the current Feasible Distance (FD) of the successor route. This ensures loop-free backup paths."

  {
    "id": "enarsi-eigrp-003",
    "question": "What algorithm does EIGRP use to calculate the best path and maintain loop-free routing?",
    "options": ["SPF (Shortest Path First)", "Bellman-Ford", "DUAL (Diffusing Update Algorithm)", "Dijkstra"],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "EIGRP uses DUAL (Diffusing Update Algorithm) to calculate the best path and guarantee loop-free routing. DUAL allows EIGRP to quickly converge when a route becomes unavailable by using pre-calculated backup routes (feasible successors) without requiring a new route computation."
  },
  {
    "id": "enarsi-eigrp-004",
    "question": "What is the purpose of EIGRP stub routing?",
    "options": ["To prevent queries from being sent to stub routers, improving convergence", "To reduce routing table size on the stub router", "To disable route summarization", "To enable load balancing across multiple paths"],
    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "EIGRP stub routing prevents query messages from being sent to stub routers (typically spoke routers in hub-and-spoke topologies). This reduces unnecessary query propagation, speeds convergence, and prevents routing loops. Stub routers advertise only specified route types."
  },
  {
    "id": "enarsi-eigrp-005",
    "question": "Which EIGRP packet type is used to acknowledge the receipt of Update, Query, and Reply packets?",
    "options": ["Hello", "Update", "Query", "ACK (Acknowledgment)"],
    "correct": 3,
    "explanation": "EIGRP uses ACK (Acknowledgment) packets to reliably deliver Update, Query, and Reply packets. ACK packets are unicast and contain no data. Hello packets are not acknowledged. This reliable transport mechanism is called RTP (Reliable Transport Protocol)."

    "id": "enarsi-eigrp-006",
    "question": "What EIGRP feature allows unequal-cost load balancing across multiple paths?",
    "options": ["Maximum paths", "Variance", "Feasible distance", "Metric weights"],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "The variance command enables unequal-cost load balancing in EIGRP. Variance multiplies the successor's FD to determine which feasible successors can be used for load balancing. For example, variance 2 allows paths with FD up to twice the successor's FD to be installed in the routing table."

    "id": "enarsi-eigrp-007",
    "question": "What is the default Hello interval for EIGRP on high-bandwidth interfaces (greater than T1 speeds)?",
    "options": ["5 seconds", "10 seconds", "30 seconds", "60 seconds"],
    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "EIGRP uses a 5-second Hello interval on high-bandwidth links (greater than 1.544 Mbps). The hold time is 3 times the Hello interval (15 seconds). On slower links (T1 and below), the Hello interval is 60 seconds with a hold time of 180 seconds."

    "id": "enarsi-eigrp-008",
    "question": "How does EIGRP for IPv6 differ from EIGRP for IPv4 in terms of neighbor discovery?",
    "options": ["IPv6 uses multicast FF02::A instead of 224.0.0.10", "IPv6 requires manual neighbor configuration", "IPv6 does not use Hello packets", "IPv6 uses broadcast for neighbor discovery"],
    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "EIGRP for IPv6 uses the link-local multicast address FF02::A for neighbor discovery and updates, while EIGRP for IPv4 uses 224.0.0.10. Both versions use Hello packets for neighbor discovery, but IPv6 uses link-local addresses for peering."

  {
    "id": "enarsi-eigrp-009",
    "question": "What is the main benefit of using EIGRP named mode configuration instead of classic mode?",
    "options": ["Named mode supports authentication; classic mode does not", "Named mode provides a hierarchical configuration structure for IPv4, IPv6, and VRF instances", "Named mode uses less memory", "Named mode converges faster"],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "EIGRP named mode provides a hierarchical configuration structure that simplifies management of IPv4, IPv6, and VRF instances under a single EIGRP process. It also supports newer features like SHA authentication and per-interface configuration under address families."

    "id": "enarsi-eigrp-010",
    "question": "In EIGRP, what does the feasibility condition prevent?",
    "options": ["Suboptimal routing", "Routing loops", "Split horizon violations", "Excessive bandwidth usage"],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "The feasibility condition in EIGRP prevents routing loops by ensuring that a backup route's Advertised Distance is less than the current route's Feasible Distance. This guarantees that the backup path does not route through the current router, making it loop-free."
  },
  {
    "id": "enarsi-eigrp-011",
    "question": "What does it mean when an EIGRP route is 'stuck in active' (SIA)?",
    "options": ["The route is actively being used for forwarding and cannot be removed", "A query for a lost route has not received a reply within the SIA timer, indicating a convergence problem", "The route is in the topology table but has not been installed in the routing table", "EIGRP is actively redistributing the route into another protocol"],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "When EIGRP loses a route and has no feasible successor, it sends queries to neighbors. If a neighbor does not reply within the SIA timer (default 3 minutes), the route is declared stuck-in-active, and the neighbor relationship is reset. SIA conditions typically indicate a query is propagating too far or a neighbor is slow to respond."

  {
    "id": "enarsi-eigrp-012",
    "question": "Which two authentication methods does EIGRP support for securing neighbor relationships?",
    "options": ["Plain-text and AES-256", "MD5 and HMAC-SHA-256", "PAP and CHAP", "RSA signatures and Diffie-Hellman"],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "EIGRP supports MD5 authentication (classic mode and named mode) and HMAC-SHA-256 authentication (named mode only). Both methods use a shared key to generate a hash of EIGRP packets, ensuring that only routers with the correct key can form adjacencies. SHA-256 is the stronger and recommended option."

    "id": "enarsi-eigrp-013",
    "question": "When you configure EIGRP route summarization on an interface, what route is automatically added to the summarizing router's routing table?",
    "options": ["A default route (0.0.0.0/0) pointing to that interface", "A summary route pointing to Null0 to prevent routing loops", "A static route to the longest-match prefix within the summary", "A floating static route with an administrative distance of 255"],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "When EIGRP summarizes routes on an interface, it installs a summary route pointing to Null0 (the discard route) in the local routing table. This prevents routing loops — if a packet arrives for a more-specific prefix that does not exist, it is dropped at the summarizing router rather than being forwarded in a loop."

  {
    "id": "enarsi-eigrp-014",
    "question": "EIGRP wide metrics use a 64-bit composite metric. What is the primary reason Cisco introduced wide metrics in EIGRP named mode?",
    "options": ["To support authentication with longer key lengths", "To accurately represent high-bandwidth interfaces (10G, 40G, 100G) that classic 32-bit metrics cannot differentiate", "To allow EIGRP to carry IPv6 prefixes", "To increase the maximum hop count beyond 255"],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Classic EIGRP uses a 32-bit metric calculation where bandwidth is scaled such that interfaces faster than approximately 10 Gbps all compute to the same minimum metric value. Wide metrics use 64-bit values with a scaled bandwidth formula (EIGRP_BANDWIDTH = 10^7 * 65536 / bandwidth_kbps) that can differentiate between 10G, 40G, 100G, and faster links."

  {
    "id": "enarsi-eigrp-015",
    "question": "What is the effect of configuring 'passive-interface' on an EIGRP-enabled interface?",
    "options": ["The interface sends Hellos but does not accept them from neighbors", "The interface stops sending and receiving EIGRP Hellos, preventing neighbor formation, but the connected network is still advertised", "The interface forms adjacencies but does not advertise its connected network", "The interface is completely removed from the EIGRP process"],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Configuring passive-interface in EIGRP suppresses Hello packets on that interface, which prevents EIGRP neighbor adjacencies from forming. However, the network connected to that interface is still advertised in EIGRP updates sent out other (non-passive) interfaces. This is commonly used on LAN segments where no EIGRP neighbors exist."

    "id": "enarsi-eigrp-016",
    "question": "In a DMVPN network running EIGRP, what issue can occur if split-horizon is not disabled on the hub's tunnel interface?",
    "options": ["EIGRP packets will not be encrypted by IPsec", "Routes learned from one spoke will not be advertised to other spokes through the hub", "The hub will not form EIGRP adjacencies with any spoke", "EIGRP will use the wrong next-hop address for spoke-to-spoke traffic"],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "EIGRP split-horizon prevents a router from advertising routes back out the same interface they were learned on. On a DMVPN hub's multipoint GRE tunnel interface, all spokes are reachable through the same interface. With split-horizon enabled, routes learned from one spoke are not advertised to other spokes. Disabling split-horizon ('no ip split-horizon eigrp <AS>') on the hub tunnel interface resolves this."

    "question": "An enterprise network running EIGRP experiences SIA events during convergence. An engineer wants to limit query scope without changing the topology. Which combination of techniques is MOST effective at reducing EIGRP query propagation?",
    "options": ["Increase the hold timer and enable passive-interface on all LAN segments", "Configure EIGRP stub routing on remote branch routers and use route summarization at distribution layer routers", "Reduce the Hello interval to 1 second and enable EIGRP authentication on all links", "Enable EIGRP wide metrics and increase the variance multiplier for load balancing"],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "EIGRP stub routing on branch routers tells the hub that stubs will never be transit routers, so the hub never sends queries to them — dramatically reducing query scope. Route summarization at distribution routers creates query boundaries because a router that has a summary route and loses a component route does not need to query further. Together, these two techniques are the most effective way to contain query propagation and prevent SIA conditions."
