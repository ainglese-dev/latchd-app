    "question": "Which OSPF LSA type represents external routes redistributed into OSPF from another routing protocol?",
    "options": ["Type 1 (Router LSA)", "Type 3 (Summary LSA)", "Type 5 (External LSA)", "Type 7 (NSSA External LSA)"],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "Type 5 LSAs represent external routes redistributed into OSPF by an ASBR (Autonomous System Boundary Router). These LSAs flood throughout the entire OSPF domain except into stub areas and totally stubby areas."
  },
  {
    "id": "enarsi-ospf-002",
    "question": "What is the primary difference between a stub area and a totally stubby area in OSPF?",
    "options": ["Stub areas block Type 5 LSAs; totally stubby areas block Type 3, 4, and 5 LSAs", "Totally stubby areas block Type 5 LSAs; stub areas allow them", "Stub areas require virtual links; totally stubby areas do not", "There is no functional difference"],
    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "Stub areas block Type 5 (external) and Type 4 (ASBR summary) LSAs but allow Type 3 (summary) LSAs from other areas. Totally stubby areas go further by also blocking Type 3 LSAs, replacing them with a default route injected by the ABR (Cisco proprietary)."
  },
  {
    "id": "enarsi-ospf-003",
    "question": "Which OSPF router role is responsible for performing route summarization between areas?",
    "options": ["Internal Router", "ABR (Area Border Router)", "ASBR (Autonomous System Boundary Router)", "DR (Designated Router)"],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "The ABR (Area Border Router) connects multiple OSPF areas and is responsible for inter-area route summarization. It converts Type 1 and Type 2 LSAs from one area into Type 3 summary LSAs for advertisement into other areas."
  },
  {
    "id": "enarsi-ospf-004",
    "question": "On an OSPF broadcast network, what happens if all routers have the same OSPF priority?",
    "options": ["No DR/BDR is elected", "The router with the highest Router ID becomes DR", "The router with the lowest Router ID becomes DR", "All routers become DR"],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "When OSPF priorities are equal, the router with the highest Router ID becomes the DR (Designated Router), and the second-highest becomes the BDR (Backup Designated Router). Router ID is determined by the highest loopback IP or highest physical interface IP."
  },
  {
    "id": "enarsi-ospf-005",
    "question": "What is the purpose of an OSPF virtual link?",
    "options": ["To connect non-backbone areas directly to each other", "To connect a remote area to Area 0 through a transit area", "To create redundant paths within Area 0", "To reduce the size of the LSDB"],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Virtual links are used when a non-backbone area cannot physically connect to Area 0. The virtual link creates a logical connection through a transit area, allowing the remote area to reach the backbone. This is a temporary solution; proper design should avoid virtual links."
  },
  {
    "id": "enarsi-ospf-006",
    "question": "Which OSPF network type does NOT elect a DR/BDR?",
    "options": ["Broadcast", "Non-Broadcast (NBMA)", "Point-to-Multipoint", "Point-to-Point"],
    "correct": 3,
    "explanation": "Point-to-Point and Point-to-Multipoint network types do not elect a DR/BDR because they don't require one. Point-to-Point links have only two routers, and Point-to-Multipoint treats the network as multiple point-to-point links."
  },
  {
    "id": "enarsi-ospf-007",
    "question": "What type of LSA is generated by a DR on a broadcast segment to represent the network and all attached routers?",
    "options": ["Type 1 (Router LSA)", "Type 2 (Network LSA)", "Type 3 (Summary LSA)", "Type 4 (ASBR Summary LSA)"],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Type 2 (Network LSA) is generated by the DR on broadcast and NBMA networks. It lists all routers attached to the multi-access network and represents the pseudo-node in the OSPF topology. Only the DR generates Type 2 LSAs for its segment."
  },
  {
    "id": "enarsi-ospf-008",
    "question": "In OSPF, what is the difference between an NSSA (Not-So-Stubby Area) and a regular stub area?",
    "options": ["NSSA allows Type 5 LSAs; stub areas do not", "NSSA allows redistribution of external routes as Type 7 LSAs; stub areas do not allow any external routes", "NSSA requires a virtual link; stub areas do not", "There is no difference"],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "NSSA allows limited external route redistribution using Type 7 LSAs, which are converted to Type 5 LSAs at the ABR. Regular stub areas block all external routes (Type 5 and Type 4 LSAs). NSSA is useful when you need an ASBR in a stub-like area."
  },
  {
    "id": "enarsi-ospf-009",
    "question": "Which OSPF LSA type is used to advertise the location of an ASBR to other areas?",
    "options": ["Type 3 (Summary LSA)", "Type 4 (ASBR Summary LSA)", "Type 5 (External LSA)", "Type 7 (NSSA External LSA)"],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Type 4 LSAs are generated by ABRs to advertise the Router ID of an ASBR into other areas. This allows routers in different areas to know how to reach the ASBR to obtain external routes (Type 5 LSAs)."
  },
  {
    "id": "enarsi-ospf-010",
    "question": "What command is used to configure manual route summarization on an OSPF ABR?",
    "options": ["area range", "summary-address", "auto-summary", "ip summary-address"],
    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "The 'area range' command is used on an ABR to summarize Type 1 and Type 2 LSAs into a single Type 3 summary LSA for advertisement into other areas. The 'summary-address' command is used on an ASBR to summarize external routes (Type 5 LSAs)."
