    "options": [
      "TCP is connectionless and faster than UDP",
      "UDP provides reliable delivery with acknowledgments",
      "TCP uses a three-way handshake to establish a connection before sending data",
      "UDP guarantees in-order delivery of segments"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "TCP is a connection-oriented protocol that uses a three-way handshake (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK) to establish a reliable connection before data transfer. UDP is connectionless and does not guarantee delivery or ordering."

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "A /27 subnet mask creates blocks of 32 addresses. The address 192.168.10.45 falls in the 192.168.10.32 - 192.168.10.63 block, making 192.168.10.32 the network address."

      "8 collision domains, 1 broadcast domain",
      "1 collision domain, 8 broadcast domains"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "A hub operates at Layer 1 and does not segment traffic. All ports on a hub share a single collision domain and a single broadcast domain, meaning all devices compete for the same bandwidth."

    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "DNS recursive resolution follows a hierarchical process: the resolver first queries a root server, which directs it to the appropriate TLD (Top-Level Domain) server, which then points to the authoritative name server that holds the final answer."

    "question": "A host with IP address 10.0.1.50/24 needs to communicate with a server at 10.0.2.100/24. What role does the default gateway play in this communication?",
    "options": [
      "It translates the server's hostname to an IP address",
      "It forwards the packet to the destination since the server is on a different subnet",
      "It assigns a temporary IP address to the host for cross-subnet communication",
      "It caches the server's MAC address so the host can send frames directly"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "The default gateway is a router that forwards packets destined for hosts outside the local subnet. Since 10.0.1.0/24 and 10.0.2.0/24 are different subnets, the host sends the packet to its default gateway, which routes it toward the destination network."
