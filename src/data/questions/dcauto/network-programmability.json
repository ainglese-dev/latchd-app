    "question": "Which HTTP method is used to create a new resource on a REST API?",
    "options": ["GET", "POST", "PUT", "PATCH"],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "POST is used to create new resources. GET retrieves, PUT replaces, and PATCH partially updates existing resources."
  },
  {
    "id": "dcauto-np-002",
    "question": "Which data format is the default for most modern REST APIs?",
    "options": ["XML", "YAML", "JSON", "CSV"],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is the default format for most modern REST APIs due to its lightweight structure and readability."
  },

    "id": "dcauto-np-003",
    "question": "What does YANG stand for in the context of network automation?",
    "options": ["Yet Another Next Generation", "Your Automated Network Guide", "YAML And Netconf Grammar", "None — it is not an acronym"],
    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "YANG stands for Yet Another Next Generation. It is a data modeling language used to model configuration and state data for NETCONF and RESTCONF."
  },
  {
    "id": "dcauto-np-004",
    "question": "Which transport protocol does NETCONF use by default?",
    "options": ["HTTP", "HTTPS", "SSH", "SNMP"],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "NETCONF uses SSH (port 830) as its default transport protocol. It encodes data in XML and uses RPC-based operations."
  },
  {
    "id": "dcauto-np-005",
    "question": "How does RESTCONF differ from NETCONF?",
    "options": ["RESTCONF uses XML, NETCONF uses JSON", "RESTCONF uses HTTP/HTTPS, NETCONF uses SSH", "RESTCONF replaces YANG models", "RESTCONF is only for Cisco devices"],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "RESTCONF provides a RESTful interface over HTTP/HTTPS for accessing YANG-modeled data, while NETCONF uses SSH. Both can use YANG models."

  {
    "id": "dcauto-np-006",
    "question": "What type of API does Cisco DNA Center (Catalyst Center) expose?",
    "options": ["SNMP-based API", "Intent-based REST API", "CLI-only API", "SOAP-based API"],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Cisco DNA Center exposes an intent-based REST API that allows you to express what you want the network to do, rather than configuring individual devices."
  },
  {
    "id": "dcauto-np-007",
    "question": "Which protocol uses a subscription-based model to push operational data from network devices to a collector?",
    "options": ["SNMP polling", "Model-Driven Telemetry", "NETCONF get", "Syslog"],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Model-Driven Telemetry (MDT) uses a push-based subscription model to stream operational data from devices in near real-time, unlike SNMP which relies on polling."
  },
  {
    "id": "dcauto-np-008",
    "question": "What is the primary purpose of a YANG model in network programmability?",
    "options": ["To encrypt API traffic", "To define the structure and constraints of configuration and state data", "To replace CLI commands with Python scripts", "To manage device firmware updates"],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "YANG models define the structure, data types, and constraints of configuration and operational state data. They serve as a contract between the client and the network device."
  },
  {
    "id": "dcauto-np-009",
    "question": "Which NETCONF operation replaces the entire target configuration with the provided configuration?",
    "options": ["<edit-config> with merge", "<copy-config>", "<edit-config> with replace", "<delete-config>"],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "The <edit-config> operation with the 'replace' attribute replaces the entire target configuration subtree. <copy-config> copies between datastores, while merge only updates specified elements."
  },
  {
    "id": "dcauto-np-010",
    "question": "What encoding formats does RESTCONF support for payload data?",
    "options": ["XML only", "JSON only", "XML and JSON", "YAML and JSON"],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "RESTCONF supports both XML (application/yang-data+xml) and JSON (application/yang-data+json) encoding formats for request and response payloads."
